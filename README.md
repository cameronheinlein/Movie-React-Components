# Movie-React-Components
<h1>Task</h1>
<p>In this activity, I began with an application that pulls movie showtime data from a JSON file namedâ€¯movies.json. Each movie you see in the web browser is a Web component that was then converted into React components instead.</p>
<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>In some cases web components can be better than react components, it's important to understand how to interchange these with React components. To use, download all files and run the index.html in a local host browser. Try to change each component back to a web component using the movie.js and main.js files.</p>
